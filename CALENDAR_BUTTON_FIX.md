# 📅 Calendar "Add Event" Button Fixed

I've updated the "Add Event" button on the Calendar page.

## 🔗 What Changed
- The **"+ Add Event"** button under the calendar now redirects you to the **Care Tasks** page (`/meds`).
- This allows you to easily add new tasks, appointments, or medications using the full modal and filters available there.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Go to the **Calendar** page.
2. Click **"+ Add Event"** at the bottom of the list.
3. You will be taken to the **Care Tasks** page where you can click the big **"+"** button to add your event.

Everything is now fully integrated!
